$PATH showed its first GAAP-profitable quarter in Q4 FY24 (13 quarters after IPO), while already Non-GAAP profitable earlier, still pushing toward sustained GAAP profitability (majority of contracts are private sector).

You‚Äôre looking at SPRY‚Äôs official short interest data from FINRA, and your question ‚Äî ‚ÄúHow can this sustain?‚Äù ‚Äî is spot on. Let‚Äôs break this down:

‚∏ª

1. The Current Setup
 ‚Ä¢ Short Interest %: ~37% of float (very high).
 ‚Ä¢ Short Position: ~21.6M shares as of Sept 15, 2025.
 ‚Ä¢ Days to Cover (DTC): 6‚Äì12 days through the summer, peaking at 17+ earlier in June.
 ‚Ä¢ Trend: From June to September, shorts have added aggressively (+6M shares net in 3 months).
 ‚Ä¢ Recent change: From July 15 (14.8M shares) to Sept 15 (21.6M shares), short interest jumped by ~6.7M shares (+45%).

This means nearly half of the company‚Äôs tradable shares are borrowed and bet against it.

‚∏ª

2. Why It‚Äôs Hard to Sustain
 ‚Ä¢ Cost of Borrow (Fees): With short interest this high, borrow availability tightens and fees spike. Sustaining 20M+ borrowed shares is expensive. If borrow rates rise to double digits, shorts bleed every day.
 ‚Ä¢ Liquidity Trap: DTC of 6‚Äì12 means if shorts try to cover, it could take over a week of full volume ‚Äî creating a squeeze risk.
 ‚Ä¢ Fundamentals vs. Speculation: If catalysts (e.g., revenue growth, partnership, M&amp;A chatter, or approvals) land positively, shorts have almost no margin for error. This setup is asymmetric against them.
 ‚Ä¢ Crowded Trade: 37% SI is above levels that triggered violent squeezes in names like Carvana, GameStop, and Beyond Meat in past cycles. When too many pile in, they eventually compete to exit.

‚∏ª

3. How It Could Sustain (for now)
 ‚Ä¢ Steady Borrow Supply: If large institutions are lending out shares (ETFs, funds) and not recalling, shorts can stay put.
 ‚Ä¢ Bearish Conviction: Shorts may believe valuation is stretched or future catalysts (FDA, earnings) are negative, and they‚Äôre willing to eat borrow fees.
 ‚Ä¢ Gradual Liquidity: As long as volume remains healthy, shorts feel less trapped. A DTC at ~6 (current) is easier than 17+ (June).

‚∏ª

4. The Breaking Point

It becomes unsustainable if:
 ‚Ä¢ Borrow rates explode (20‚Äì30%+ annualized).
 ‚Ä¢ Positive catalyst hits (approval, buyout rumors, blowout quarter).
 ‚Ä¢ Volume dries up, pushing DTC higher again.

At that point, shorts will either:
 ‚Ä¢ Cover in panic ‚Üí sharp upside squeeze.
 ‚Ä¢ Get margin-called ‚Üí forced buy-ins.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Bottom line:
Sustaining 37%+ short interest at 20M+ shares is very fragile. It can persist for weeks or months if nothing big changes, but any upside shock or liquidity squeeze could unwind it violently. This is a powder keg setup ‚Äî shorts are essentially betting the company fails to deliver, while longs only need one spark."

OpenAI is competing with $googl $msft and many other companies.

Microsoft has plenty of data to then contribute to copilot. $tsla has X

If Altman wants to play ball with the big dawgs, he may try an angle by acquiring a massive amount of social media data from the large user base of gen X and worldwide snap users. Allowing him to use that data to add more value to the efficiency of ChatGPT. 

Just food for thought."

Shorts piled in, borrow rates soared, and institutions quietly accumulated. The result? The stock ripped multiples ahead of BTC.

Here‚Äôs why $ASST looks similar:
 ‚Ä¢ BTC Treasury: Nearly 11,000 coins now. At scale, ASST moves more like a BTC proxy than a med-tech rollup.
 ‚Ä¢ Institutional Accumulation: Graham (9.7%), Millennium (6%) aren&#39;t blind. They‚Äôve sat across from management, run the dilution math, and still see upside.
 ‚Ä¢ Short Pressure: CTB &gt;600% means shorts are bleeding. Any catalyst (PR, BTC rally, buyback) triggers a disorderly unwind.
 ‚Ä¢ Narrative Disconnect: Retail fixates on ‚Äúwhy pay so much for $SMLR?‚Äù Institutions know valuation models don‚Äôt matter when flows, positioning, and BTC momentum take over.

For you Eric Schmidt, please read

You may have some fun üòè

The Setup - The Billionaire Bet

‚ÄúImagine I‚Äôm Eric Schmidt. Worth $30 billion. Two billion dollars just sitting idle.

Instead of the safe routes, real estate, stocks, private equity, I go all-in on-chain.

No OTC. No closed doors. Every swap transparent.

Keeta, directly from the open market. One click at a time.

The candle that follows? Not just green, the biggest, most violent, most unstoppable surge crypto has ever seen.

A wall of liquidity so bright it splits history into a before and after. The God candle. The day Keeta becomes legend.‚Äù

The Motivation - Beyond Money

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Christian. I know no money comes with me when I go to heaven.

But I also know: impact lives forever.

I could choose to be remembered as the man who didn‚Äôt chase another yacht, or another stock.

Instead, the man who changed the game after Satoshi. The man who unleashed the candle that burned across the blockchain world.

Not with hype. Not with marketing. But with Keeta, the all-in-one layer, faster than anything humanity has ever built.‚Äù

The Vision - 100x Beyond Wealth

‚ÄúI know what I bought. I know it multiplies by 100x. But I don‚Äôt need to dump. I don‚Äôt need to crash the chart.

Instead, I create scenarios only history books could imagine:

‚Ä¢ I burn billions in Keeta - a fire offering, my name etched into every chart forever.

‚Ä¢ I sell only OTC, under iron contracts - 10-year lockups that guarantee the chart never bleeds.

‚Ä¢ I become the liquidity backstop for TradFi, Fortune 500s, sovereign wealth funds, Wall Street itself, all knocking on my door because the open market has none left. Access only through me. On my terms.‚Äù

The Legacy - The God Candle

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt greed. This isn‚Äôt another billionaire move.

This is impact.

A God candle that rewrites history books, a supernova that burns brighter than every memecoin, every airdrop, every hype cycle.

In one moment, conviction turns into culture.

And in that moment, Keeta steps out of the shadows of every chain before it, to stand beside Bitcoin itself.

Not just tech. Not just money. Myth. Legend. Destiny.‚Äù

Why this narrative shakes the room:

1. Creates a Legend ‚Üí Keeta now has a myth-story: Satoshi ‚Üí Vitalik ‚Üí Schmidt.

2. Frames Infinite Upside ‚Üí Not just 100x wealth, but the biggest chart movement in crypto history.

3. Neutralizes Fear ‚Üí No dump, only controlled power: burn, OTC lockups, or strategic liquidity.

Looking ahead to 2030, PayPal shareholders face considerable uncertainty with a forecast spanning a wide range from $4 to $11 per share. The wide spread underscores the inherent risk and unpredictability investors need to navigate over the next five years, making position sizing and risk management critical considerations for those maintaining their holdings.

Initiating a position for this Cybersecurity company

My investment thesis: 

latest yearly revenue figures for Netskope:
 ‚Ä¢ For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, Netskope reported revenue of US$538.27 million.  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ The trailing-12-months (TTM) revenue as of the quarter ended July 31, 2025, is about US$615.5 million.  

Strong ARR growth: 33%+ ARR growth is healthy, especially for a cybersecurity / SaaS / cloud business.

 ‚Ä¢ Better than some peers: The growth is above or comparable to many public cybersecurity and cloud vendors, especially in a tightening macro environment.
 ‚Ä¢ Retention is solid: 113% net retention implies not only are customers staying, but they are spending more over time ‚Äì a key sign of expanding footprint.

 ‚Ä¢ Still not profitable: While revenue is growing and losses are narrowing, profitability has not yet been achieved.  This is acceptable for any growth company. 

Major Investors &amp; Backers

These are firms that have backed Netskope over time:
 ‚Ä¢ Lightspeed Venture Partners  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Accel  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ ICONIQ Capital / ICONIQ Growth  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Sequoia Capital Global Equities  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Geodesic Capital  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Sapphire Ventures  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Base Partners  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Social Capital  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Canadian institutional investors like Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments)  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ PSP Investments  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Morgan Stanley Tactical Value  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Goldman Sachs Asset Management  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan  Ôøº
‚∏ª

Stakes / Ownership Highlights
 ‚Ä¢ Lightspeed has around 19.3% stake in Netskope prior to IPO.  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ ICONIQ Growth also has about 19.2% of the company.  Ôøº
 ‚Ä¢ Accel is another large shareholder, with a stake of roughly 9%."

Potential Market and Strategic Upsides for Verastem: 
 
Public companies like GenFleet often gain better access to talent, M&amp;A opportunities, and global collaborations post-IPO, indirectly benefiting partners by de-risking joint ventures. Analysts note that such listings enhance valuation and attract further investment in partnered programs. 
 
Verastem&#39;s stock has shown sensitivity to positive GenFleet updates (e.g., IND approvals and trial data), and the IPO could catalyze similar momentum, especially as Verastem advances VS-7375 into a U.S. Phase 1/2a trial in mid-2025. 
 
While biotech IPOs carry inherent market volatility risks,  
the oversubscription and GenFleet&#39;s track record  
(e.g., its KRAS G12C inhibitor approved in China)  
tilt this toward a net positive for Verastem&#39;s strategic positioning and program advancement.  
 
No direct negative impacts, such as partnership disruptions, were evident in recent reports."

Validation of the Partnership and Pipeline: 
The 2023 discovery &amp; development collaboration between Verastem &amp; GenFleet targets  
up to three RAS pathway-driven oncology programs  
(valued at up to $625.5 million in milestones, plus royalties).  
 
Verastem holds exclusive options on these after Phase 1 milestones, retaining ex-China rights  
while GenFleet keeps Greater China rights. 
 
GenFleet&#39;s IPO prospectus highlights its partnerships (including with Verastem &amp; Innovent Biologics)  
as key value drivers,  
which could boost the perceived worth of these assets.  
 
This external validation may encourage Verastem to pursue additional options in the deal, expanding its pipeline in high-unmet-need areas like pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers."
2025-09-18,VSTM,629227543,2025-09-18 23:53:19+00,,134,1,0,0,0.000,"$VSTM  
Strengthened Financial  
&amp; Operational Stability for GenFleetGenFleet,  
a clinical-stage biotech  
focused on oncology &amp; immunology therapies,  
is raising capital through this IPO to fund its pipeline, including RAS/MAPK pathway inhibitors like GFH375  
(licensed to Verastem as VS-7375).  
 
The strong investor interest signals market confidence in GenFleet&#39;s assets, which could provide it with substantial liquidity to accelerate R&amp;D without relying solely on milestone payments from partners like Verastem. 
 
This reduces execution risks for Verastem,  
as GenFleet&#39;s enhanced funding lowers the likelihood of delays in shared programs. 
 
For instance, Verastem has already  
exercised its option to  
exclusively license VS-7375  
(an oral KRAS G12D ON/OFF inhibitor)  
for development &amp; commercialization outside Greater China, with Phase 1 data from GenFleet&#39;s ongoing trial in China showing promising overall response rates  
(52% in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma  
&amp; 42% in non-small cell lung cancer - May 2025)."
