  "analysis": "Given the recent market performance of GME, it appears that the price is steadily declining. Increasing the sentiment threshold to 0.4 may help filter out noise and focus on stronger positive sentiment when it eventually surfaces. Extending the holding period to 5 days allows for capturing potential upward trends that may emerge over a longer duration in the current volatile environment. Increasing the position size to 15% can capitalize on potential rebounds more aggressively while managing risk effectively. Overall, these adjustments aim to improve risk-reward ratios during a recovery phase.",
